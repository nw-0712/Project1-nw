   <p>In our Nutrigenomics service (which is another biohacking type) were we focus on how you interact with food and your genes. Likewise, we explore how your genes affect your body's response to food.</p> 
    
   <h4>Immersion</h4>
    <p>This service focuses on enhancing your cognitive development and capabilities. Immersion involves deep mental involvement in which you will go through various cognitive processes (with or without sensory stimulation) will cause a shift in your attentional state such that one may experience disassociation from the awareness of the physical world.</p>
